A small example for pytest

Resouce: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pytest/pytest_environment_setup.htm

Running pytest without mentioning a filename will run all files of format test_*.py or *_test.py in the current directory and subdirectories. Pytest automatically identifies those files as test files. We can make pytest run other filenames by explicitly mentioning them.
